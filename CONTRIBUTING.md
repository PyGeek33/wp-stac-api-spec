## Contributing

Anyone building software that catalogs imagery or other geospatial assets is welcome to collaborate.
Our goal is to be a collaboration of developers, not [architecture astronauts](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html).

The best way to contribute is to try to implement the specification and give feedback on what worked
well and what could be improved. Any proposed changes to the specification should be done as pull requests. Ideally a
proposed change would also update all of the examples, but for now that is not required - the team
can validate and update all examples before a release. But it is recommended to update at least a
couple examples to reflect the change.

All pull requests require a review of two team members.
